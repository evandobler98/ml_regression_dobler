    "### **Introduction:**\n",
    "Businesses and organizations often need to understand the relationships between different factors to make better decisions. For example, a company may want to predict the fuel efficiency of a car based on its weight and engine size or estimate home prices based on square footage and location. Regression analysis helps identify and quantify these relationships between numerical features, providing insights that can be used for forecasting and decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project focuses on many factors that contribute to the sale price of a home through the dataset 'USA Housing Dataset.csv. This project focuses on my ability to apply regression modeling techniques to a real-world dataset."
