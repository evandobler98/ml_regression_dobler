# Peer Review of [ml_regression_jballard.ipynb](https://github.com/JBtallgrass/ml_regression_jballard/blob/main/ml_regression_jballard.ipynb)

## 1. Clarity & Organization
- **Positive**: The notebook is generally well-structured and easy to follow. The sections are logically ordered, starting from data exploration to model training and evaluation.
- **Constructive Feedback**: Some sections could benefit from more detailed explanations, especially in the data cleaning and feature engineering parts. For example, it would be helpful to elaborate on why certain features were selected or transformed. Adding markdown cells before each code block with short descriptions would improve the flow.

## 2. Feature Selection & Justification
- **Positive**: The feature selection process appears reasonable. The features chosen are relevant to the prediction task, such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and square footage.
- **Constructive Feedback**: Consider explaining why certain features were kept or removed in more detail. For instance, the choice of features like **sqft_living** and **bedrooms** makes sense for housing price prediction, but discussing the rationale behind not including others (like year built or condition) could provide clarity. Additionally, consider including correlation analysis to further justify feature selection.

## 3. Model Performance & Comparisons
- **Positive**: The results are presented clearly, and the performance metrics (R², MAE, RMSE) are well explained. There is a clear comparison between different models, which helps in understanding how the performance improves or deteriorates with different preprocessing and feature selection steps.
- **Constructive Feedback**: The comparison of models could benefit from a more in-depth discussion of model limitations. For instance, it would be helpful to explain why one model outperforms the other in terms of feature interactions or data characteristics. A more thorough discussion of model diagnostics (like residual plots or performance on different subsets of data) could add value.

## 4. Reflection Quality
- **Positive**: The reflections provide valuable insights into the challenges faced and the decision-making process behind model choices. The self-assessment of model performance is clear and thoughtful.
- **Constructive Feedback**: The reflection section could be expanded to include more specific insights on potential improvements. For example, it would be interesting to explore how further tuning or additional data might improve the model's performance. Also, suggesting future experiments (like trying ensemble methods or using more advanced models) could be helpful.

## Suggested Improvements
1. **More Detailed Explanations**: As mentioned, a few sections would benefit from more descriptive comments about the rationale behind feature selection, data preprocessing, and model choices.
2. **Model Tuning**: It would be useful to see an experiment with hyperparameter tuning or cross-validation to optimize model performance.
3. **Visualizations**: Adding more plots, such as correlation heatmaps or residual plots, would provide better insight into the model’s performance and areas for improvement.

### Final Thoughts
Overall, the notebook is a strong attempt at solving the problem, with clear structure and appropriate feature selection. With a few adjustments and additional explanations, it could become even more effective. Keep up the great work!
